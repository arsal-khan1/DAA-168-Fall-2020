## Description

N queens backtracking algorithm is much more efficient by any brute force approach. I analyzed that all variables over which an implicit constraint is defined are assigned, it verifies that constraint. If the constraint fails, then it immediately assigns a different value to the variables. 

Whereas, Brute force search only takes the explicit constraints into account which means it assigns all possible values from Si to a variable xi and this for all variables. After it has constructed such a configuration, it verifies that all implicit constraints are satisfied. 

Backtracking is offering a decent speed that is why it is widely used if we want faster execution time.

I faced a searching problem for backtracking because no proper solution can be found on the internet. Lots of available solutions have bugs in them when I ran those codes. Then I took changes in the code after reading a research paper on the backtracking algorithm for the n queens problem.

This repository contains assignments and project submitted to DM course offered in Fall 2020 at PafKiet.
