## Description

The worst case brute force solution for the N-queens puzzle has an O(n^n) time complexity. This means it will look through every position on an NxN board, N times, for N queens. It is by far the slowest and most impractical method. If we refactor and prevent it from checking queens occupying the same row as each other, it will still be brute force.

It gets slower rapidly. To find the 73,712 13x13 boards takes it nearly 20 minutes, and time will go up rapidly beyond that 14x14 probably would take more and more time to execute.

I faced searching problem for brute force because no proper solution can be find on internet. Lots of available solutions have bugs in them when I ran those codes. Then I took changes in the code after reading brute algorithm for n queens problem.
